CREDIT SCORING MODEL
Project description:

Build a credit scoring model to predict the creditworthiness of
applicants. Use features like income, debt, and credit history.

Code description:

This code generates synthetic data for income, debt, and credit history. Based on these features, it creates a target variable creditworthiness, where a simple rule is applied to determine if an applicant is creditworthy or not. Then, a Random Forest classifier model is trained on this synthetic data to predict creditworthiness. Finally, it evaluates the model's performance using accuracy and classification report.
